# FPL Multi-Level AI Agent Demo - Complete Documentation

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a sophisticated demonstration of a multi-level AI agent for Florida Power & Light (FPL) customer service, showcasing the evolution from basic chatbots to proactive AI agents with structured output capabilities.

### Key Demonstration Points

1. **Proactive vs Reactive**: Shows how AI agents take automatic actions without waiting for approval
2. **Structured Output**: Premium level returns actionable JSON data, not just text
3. **Cost-Effective Architecture**: 4 AI levels with 92% cost savings vs all-premium approach
4. **Real Actions**: Creates tickets, sends notifications, applies credits automatically
5. **The 3 Pillars**: Brain (LLM), Memory (persistent context), and Goals (objective-driven)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 4 AI Sophistication Levels

| Level | Name | Cost/Query | Capabilities | Use Case |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Basic NLP** | Keywords Only | $0.002 | ‚Ä¢ Simple pattern matching<br>‚Ä¢ Template responses<br>‚Ä¢ Basic ticket creation | High-volume, simple queries |
| **Advanced NLP** | ML Models | $0.02 | ‚Ä¢ spaCy NER + BERT<br>‚Ä¢ Intent classification<br>‚Ä¢ Smart routing | Most customer interactions |
| **Local LLM** | Llama/Mistral | $0.05 | ‚Ä¢ Context understanding<br>‚Ä¢ Multi-action capability<br>‚Ä¢ Natural responses | Complex issues |
| **Claude API** | Premium | $0.10 | ‚Ä¢ Structured output<br>‚Ä¢ Full automation<br>‚Ä¢ Predictive actions | High-value customers |

### The 3 Core Pillars

#### üß† 1. Brain (Changes per level)
- **Basic**: Regex patterns and keywords
- **Advanced**: ML models (spaCy, BERT)
- **Local LLM**: Open-source language models
- **Premium**: Claude API with structured output

#### üíæ 2. Memory (Persistent across all levels)
- Customer profile and history
- Area outage information
- Conversation context
- Past interactions
- Sentiment tracking

#### üéØ 3. Goals (Dynamic based on context)
- Resolve issues efficiently
- Prevent escalations
- Improve satisfaction
- Automate appropriate actions

## üìã Features

### Automated Actions
- **Create Tickets**: Automatically generates service tickets with appropriate priority
- **Send Notifications**: SMS updates for outage status
- **Apply Credits**: Automatic compensation for extended outages
- **Schedule Callbacks**: Post-restoration follow-ups
- **Priority Restoration**: Flags critical customers (medical equipment, etc.)

### Structured Output (Premium Level)
```json
{
  "customer_response": "Natural language response",
  "intent": "outage_report",
  "intent_confidence": 0.98,
  "entities": {
    "location": "Miami Beach",
    "duration": "2 hours"
  },
  "sentiment_score": -0.5,
  "emotional_state": "frustrated",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "create_ticket",
      "priority": "high",
      "data": {"ticket_id": "TKT-123"}
    }
  ],

## üíª Usage

### Test Scenarios

1. **"I have not power"** - Tests grammar understanding
   - Basic: ‚ùå Fails (no keyword match)
   - Advanced: ‚úÖ Partially understands
   - Local/Premium: ‚úÖ Perfect understanding

2. **"Power out in Miami Beach"** - Standard outage report
   - All levels handle this correctly
   - Different sophistication in response

3. **"Electricity off since yesterday, work from home!"** - Complex + emotional
   - Basic: Generic response
   - Advanced: Better understanding
   - Premium: Full context + automatic credit

### Key Differentiators by Level

#### Basic NLP (Keywords)
```
Input: "I have not power"
Output: "How can I help?"  ‚ùå Doesn't understand
Actions: None
```

#### Advanced NLP (ML Models)
```
Input: "I have not power"
Output: "Power outage confirmed in your area. Estimated restoration: 2-3 hours."
Actions: ‚úÖ Ticket created, ‚úÖ SMS sent
```

#### Local LLM
```
Input: "I have not power"
Output: "Hello 12345, I see you're experiencing an outage. This is a known issue 
         in Miami Beach affecting multiple customers. Crews are on-site. 
         Estimated restoration: 2:30 PM."
Actions: ‚úÖ Priority ticket, ‚úÖ SMS sent, ‚úÖ Credit applied
```

#### Claude API (Premium)
```
Input: "I have not power"
Output: [Natural, empathetic response with precise details]
Structured Output: Full JSON with all extracted entities, sentiment analysis,
                  automated actions, and next steps
Actions: ‚úÖ All appropriate actions based on context
```

## ü§ù Demo Talking Points

1. **Opening**: "This demonstrates how FPL can evolve from reactive chatbots to proactive AI agents"
2. **Key Differentiator**: "Notice how each level not only responds differently but takes different actions automatically"
3. **Cost Efficiency**: "By routing 70% of queries to the Advanced level, we save 82% vs all-premium while maintaining quality"
4. **Structured Output**: "The premium level returns actionable JSON, enabling full automation and integration"
5. **Real Impact**: "This isn't just chat - it's creating tickets, sending notifications, and applying credits automatically"

## üìù Interview Q&A Prep

**Q: Why not use LangChain?**
A: "For this demo, direct implementation better shows the progression between levels. In production, we'd use LangChain for RAG with FPL's knowledge base, but not for the core agent logic."

**Q: How do you prevent inappropriate automated actions?**
A: "Each level has guardrails. Credits require specific conditions, and high-impact actions need premium-level confidence scores."

**Q: What about hallucinations?**
A: "The structured output enforces specific formats, and we validate all actions against business rules before execution."

**Q: How does this scale?**
A: "The level routing is key - 90% of queries don't need premium AI. We can handle 10x volume by smart routing, not 10x infrastructure."

## üö® Important Notes

- **Demo Mode**: Uses mock data and simulated actions
- **API Key**: Claude API key optional but recommended for full demo
- **Performance**: Streamlit reload maintains state properly
- **Customization**: Easy to modify for specific use cases
